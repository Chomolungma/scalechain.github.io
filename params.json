{"name":"ScaleChain.io","tagline":"ScaleChain github page","body":"### Problem\r\nThe number of Bitcoin transactions are [growing over time](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all), but Bitcoin full nodes require to keep all transactions from genesis block. The size of blockchain is also [growing over time](https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size?timespan=all). Increasing block size of Bitcoin is not an ultimate solution to this problem, as Bitcoin core still needs to keep all transactions data in a  node.\r\n\r\n### Possible Solutions\r\nThere are three ways to solve this issue.\r\n\r\n1. Reduce database size for a node by data compression techniques.  \r\n2. Reduce the transactions on blocks using [Sidechain](https://blockstream.com/), and off-chain transactions.\r\n3. Distribute data across nodes. ex> [Tree-chain](https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg04388.html) by [Peter Todd](https://twitter.com/petertoddbtc).\r\n\r\nIn case you have an idea, feel free to visit the [Bitcoin Scalability](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/bitcoin-scalability) forum.\r\n\r\n### About ScaleChain.io\r\nScaleChain.io builds a scalable blockchain infrastructure. \r\n\r\n### About Founder \r\nKangmo Kim is the founder of ScaleChain.io.
