{"name":"ScaleChain.io","tagline":"Build a scalable blockchain infrastructure.","body":"### Problem\r\nThe number of Bitcoin transactions is [growing over time](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all), but a Bitcoin full node requires to keep all transactions from the genesis block. The size of blockchain is also [growing over time](https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size?timespan=all). Increasing block size of Bitcoin is not an ultimate solution to this problem, as Bitcoin core still needs to keep all transactions data in a node, which has limited storage.\r\n\r\n### Possible Solutions\r\nFollowings are ideas trying to solve the problem.\r\n\r\n1. Reduce database size for a node with data compression techniques.  \r\n2. Reduce the transactions on blocks using [Sidechain](https://blockstream.com/), and off-chain transactions.\r\n3. Distribute data across nodes. ex> [Tree-chain](https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg04388.html) by [Peter Todd](https://twitter.com/petertoddbtc).\r\n\r\nIn case you have an idea, feel free to visit [Blockchain Scalability](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/blockchain-scalability) forum.\r\n\r\n### About ScaleChain.io\r\nScaleChain.io builds a scalable blockchain infrastructure. \r\n\r\n### About Founder \r\nKangmo Kim is the founder of ScaleChain.io. He started software development since 1987. After developing an in-memory SQL database engine, [Altibase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altibase) for five years, he worked at Microsoft China.
