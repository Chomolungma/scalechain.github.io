{"name":"ScaleChain.io","tagline":"ScaleChain github page","body":"### Problem\r\nThe number of Bitcoin transactions are [growing over time](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all), but Bitcoin full nodes require to keep all transactions from genesis block. The size of blockchain is also [growing over time](https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size?timespan=all). Increasing block size of Bitcoin is not an ultimate solution to this problem, as Bitcoin core still needs to keep all transactions data in a single node.\r\n\r\n### ScaleChain.io\r\nScaleChain.io focuses on solving the scalability issue of Bitcoin's blockchain. \r\nThere are three ways to solve this issue.\r\n\r\n1. Reduce database size for a node.  \r\n2. Reduce the transactions on blocks using side chains, and off-chain transactions.\r\n\r\n### About Kangmo Kim \r\nKangmo Kim is founder of ScaleChain.io.
